        <p class="about">A cozy bacon, cheese, and potato dish from the French Alps</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 pounds potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1/2 pound slab bacon, cut in small dice</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound Reblochon-style cheese, sliced</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350°F. Place potatoes in a medium pot over medium heat, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Cook for about 20 minutes, or until potatoes are easily pierced with a knife. Remove from heat, drain, and let sit until they are cool enough to handle. Cut potatoes into small pieces and set aside. </p>
        <p>Cook bacon in a sauté pan over medium heat until browned. Drain, leaving 1 tablespoon of fat in skillet and add onion. Cook over moderately high heat until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add bacon and wine to pan and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add potatoes and season with salt and pepper. </p>
        <p>Remove potato mixture from heat and spoon half into ovenproof dish. Place half of the cheese slices on top of potato mixture. Spoon remaining potato mixture on top of cheese, then top with remaining cheese. Bake tartiflette until golden brown and bubbling, about 20 minutes. Serve hot. </p>

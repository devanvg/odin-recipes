        <p class="about">Sweet potatoes take center stage in this unfussy, boozy riff on a classic by Anthony Bourdain and Laurie Woolever.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>3 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup apple cider</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>Preheat oven to 400°F. Grease a 13- x 9-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high. Boil sweet potatoes, stirring occasionally, until barely tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain potatoes, and transfer to prepared baking dish.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, combine brown sugar and remaining 5 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan; cook over medium, stirring often, until butter is melted, about 2 minutes. Whisk in cider, bourbon, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium, and cook, stirring often, until sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour sugar mixture over sweet potatoes, and toss to coat; spread evenly in baking dish.</p>
        <p>Bake in preheated oven until sweet potatoes are tender and sauce has thickened to a syrupy consistency, 35 to 40 minutes. Serve hot.</p>
